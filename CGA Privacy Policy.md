**Effective date:** 2025-09-12  
**Last updated:** 2025-09-13

## 1) Scope
This policy applies to the **C.G.A mobile application** only. If you open external links (e.g., online rulebooks), you will leave the app and those websites have their own privacy policies.

## 2) Data Not Collected
**The developer does not collect any data from this app.**  
C.G.A does not transmit personal information to our servers (we do not operate any servers for this app).

## 3) On‑Device Data & Deletion
- Gameplay values (life totals, counters, settings) run **entirely on‑device** and are **temporary**.  
- To remove local data, use in‑app reset options or **uninstall the app**.

> If a future version adds optional saved preferences, we will clearly explain what is stored on‑device and how to delete it, and we will update this policy before release.

## 4) Third‑Party Services
- **No analytics**, **no advertising**, **no social login**, **no crash reporting SDKs**.  
- Opening external links leaves the app; those sites have their own policies.

## 5) Device Permissions
C.G.A **does not request** sensitive permissions (camera, microphone, location, contacts, photos, Bluetooth, etc.). If a future feature requires a permission, we will request consent in‑app and update this policy first.

## 6) Children’s Privacy
The app is **not directed to children under 13**. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children. If you believe a child has provided information via support email, contact us and we will delete it.

## 7) Regional Notices
**EU/EEA/UK (GDPR).** We do not process personal data within the app. If you email us, we will process the information you provide **only to respond**, based on our **legitimate interests** (Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR), and we will delete it when no longer needed for that purpose.  
**California (CCPA/CPRA).** We **do not “sell” or “share”** personal information as defined by California law and do not engage in targeted advertising.

## 8) Security
Because no personal data is collected by the app, the primary risk surface is your local device. Please keep your device OS up to date and use device security features (e.g., passcode/biometrics).

## 9) Changes to This Policy
We may update this policy to reflect app changes or legal requirements. We will revise the **Effective date / Last updated** lines above and publish the latest version at this URL.

## 10) Contact
Questions about privacy?  
**Email:** cga4p@hotmail.com

## 11) Affiliation Notice
C.G.A is an independent project and is **not affiliated with or endorsed by any card game publishers**.
